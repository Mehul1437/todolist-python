# 📝 ToDo List – Python CLI App

A simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python. It allows users to add, view, complete, and delete tasks—all managed in a plain text file (`tasks.txt`).

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks  
- 📋 View all tasks  
- ☑️ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- 💾 Persistent storage using a text file  

## 📂 How It Works

Tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file in the same directory. Each task is prefixed with:
- `[ ]` for incomplete tasks  
- `[x]` for completed tasks  

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
